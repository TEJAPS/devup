Here are the steps for DMN simulation:

Step 1: Open the following page: https://consulting.camunda.com/dmn-simulator/

Step 2: Select the "Dish" DMN and replace the name with "Risk Calculator":
   2.1: Provide the input as "region" with the data type as "string".
   2.2: Provide the input as "amount" with the type as "long".
   2.3: Set the hit policy to "UNIQUE".
   
Step 3: Create an output named "riskscore" with the type "long" and provide annotations for self-explanatory purposes. Then, click on "View DRD" to go back to the Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD).

Step 4: Provide the following records:
   region, amount, riskscore
   country1, [0..100], 5
   country2, [0..1000[, 6
   country3, [0..500], 7
   country1, >100, 8
   country2, >=1000, 9
   country3, >500, 10
   
Step 5: Select the "Beverage" DMN and replace the name with "Queue Assignment":
   5.1: Provide the input as "riskscore" with the data type as "long".
   5.2: Provide the input as "transactiontype" with the type as "string".
   5.3: Update the hit policy to "FIRST". At the same time, explain the other hit policies: "UNIQUE", "FIRST", "PRIORITY", "ANY", "COLLECT", "COLLECT(SUM)", "COLLECT(MIN)", "COLLECT(MAX)", "COLLECT(COUNT)", "RULE ORDER", "OUTPUT ORDER".

Step 6: Create an output named "queue" with the type "integer" and provide annotations for self-explanatory purposes. Then, click on "View DRD" to go back to the Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD).

Step 7: Provide the following records:
   riskscore, transactiontype, queue
   <7, "type1","type2","type3", 1
   [7..9], "type1","typ2", 2
   >=10, "type3", 3
   [7..9], "type3", 4
   >=10, "type2", 4
   >=10, "type1", 5
   1, "type1", 4
   Click on "View DRD" to generate the output.

Step 7: Provide the definition name as "Risk Cal" and click on "DRD" to view the output diagram.

Step 8: Provide input notations to our "Risk Cal" as "Region" and "Amount" with an Oval Symbol to showcase the flow of logic.
and similarly provide Oval annotations input to Queue Assignment as "Type of transaction"
