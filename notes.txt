Notes:

Part1:
Issues with current system:
The manual fraud review process by operations has multiple steps and it takes around 6 to 10 mins to review each transaction
Need a better queue management for ops team to prioritise and work on alerts
Volumes are forecasted to grow each year and ops team is unable to complete the review for entire volume and Managing the net operating fraud losses
Less visibility into the work progress and queue penetration

Part2:
Difficulty in introducing new changes
Downtime for introducing new changes

Part3:
***Time gap between action disposition vs communicating the same to dependency teams.

Solution:
---------
Part1:
Automate the manual workflow steps like to enrich, take certain actions
Automate the decision process , listing out the red flags and recommend the decision (Refer to notes generator they currently use)

Part2:
Customized log level details as per application need - Audit level, Info level
Online BPMN Migration - 0 downtime
Online DMN Migration - 0 downtime
Can be handled by the client without developer's intervention - Easy to understand, adapt and modify.
Inbuilt retry mechanisms, and 

Part3:
When few actions are taken and informed to downstreams but the actions are not required anymore - compensatory activities for rollback.



Details:
--------
Identify the workflows:  Analyse and identify the current manual steps, decision points and actions involved in working a fraud case manually by ops team. Some of the activities like Customer profiling - reviewing the customer details, account and transaction history and online activity, and in some cases recipient profiling. All of these information can be prefetched and to decisions some of the activities as red flags. Actions like restrict, block profile, hold, release , letters, customer contact.
Model the BPMN workflow: work  with business to document the various workflow steps
Configure workflow execution:  orchestrate the workflow with connectors to the APIs, micro services, user tasks
Handle user tasks:
Implement Automated Activities: Automate certain activities in fraud case review like data enrichment, determine the red flags, integrate with external services for actions like customer contact/restrict/block/hold based on the outcome of the decision. These are implemented in Camunda as service tasks.
Handle Decision Making:
